# ALX Listing App

A modern, scalable Airbnb clone built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This project serves as the foundation for a comprehensive property listing platform, focusing on clean architecture, reusable components, and professional development practices.

## 🎯 Project Description and Goals

The ALX Listing App is designed to create a robust foundation for an Airbnb-style property rental platform. Our primary goals include:

- **Scalable Architecture**: Establish a well-organized codebase that can grow with feature additions
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Leverage Next.js 13+, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for optimal performance
- **Reusable Components**: Build a library of modular UI components for consistent design
- **Type Safety**: Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for maintainable code
- **Professional Standards**: Follow industry best practices for production-ready applications
- **User Experience**: Create an intuitive, responsive interface for property browsing and booking

The project currently focuses on the foundational listing page where users can browse properties, search for accommodations, and explore different property types. Future iterations will include booking functionality, user authentication, payment processing, and host management features.

## 📁 Project Structure

### Directory Purpose Explanation

#### `components/`

Houses all reusable UI components, organized by usage pattern:

- **`common/`**: Generic components used across multiple pages (Button, Card, Modal, etc.)
- **`layout/`**: Components specific to page layout structure (Header, Footer, Sidebar, etc.)

Each component follows a consistent structure with its own directory containing the component file and an index.ts for clean imports.

#### `interfaces/`

Contains all TypeScript type definitions and interfaces, promoting:

- **Type Safety**: Ensures data consistency across the application
- **Developer Experience**: Provides IntelliSense and error detection
- **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation for data structures
- **Maintainability**: Makes refactoring safer and more predictable

#### `constants/`

Stores application-wide constants and configuration:

- **API Endpoints**: Centralized API URL management
- **UI Constants**: Navigation items, color schemes, breakpoints
- **Business Logic**: Property types, amenities, pricing tiers
- **Configuration**: App metadata, feature flags, default values

#### `public/assets/`

Organizes static assets for optimal performance and maintainability:

- **`images/`**: Property photos, hero backgrounds, placeholder images
- **`icons/`**: SVG icons for consistent, scalable iconography
- **`logo/`**: Brand assets and logo variations for different contexts

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your development machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: Version 8.0.0 or higher (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**: For version control (optional but recommended)

You can verify your installations by running:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project files):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd alx-listing-app
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all required packages including:
   - Next.js framework
   - React and React DOM
   - TypeScript and type definitions
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Additional development tools

3. **Set up environment variables** (optional):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Edit `.env.local` to add any required environment variables for your development setup.

### Running the Development Server

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Begin development**: The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the source code.

### Available Scripts

The project includes several useful npm scripts for development:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Create production build
npm run start        # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint to check for code issues
npm run lint:fix     # Automatically fix ESLint issues
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript compiler check

# Formatting
npm run format       # Format code using Prettier
npm run format:check # Check if code is properly formatted

# Analysis
npm run analyze      # Analyze bundle size (requires ANALYZE=true)
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Make your changes** to the source code
3. **Check code quality**: `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check`
4. **Format your code**: `npm run format`
5. **Test your changes** in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`
6. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message
